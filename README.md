# QuadTreeProject

This is a project from my CMSC420: Advanced Data Structures. In it, I implemented a QuadTree with various functions listed in quad_tree.c. 

Sample input is given in the sample_input.in file. These results can be compared with the output in the sample_output.in file.

To run this sample input, please download the source code and navigate to the project in your respective terminal. Use the command "make" to create the "part4" executable, then run the command "./part4 < sample_input.in" to generate output.
